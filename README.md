This project is a full-stack web app I built for my INFR3120 assignment. I chose a Pet Care Manager because most people with pets keep their info in random places — screenshots, notes, reminders, etc. I wanted something simple that puts everything together and feels useful, not just something made for marks.

The app lets users add pets, update details, track health info, and remove entries when they’re no longer needed. Everything shows up in a clean dashboard that’s easy to read.
